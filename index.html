            Meme is a popular form of expression among contemporary internet users, often conveying rich emotional content such as
            humor and satire. In recent years, tasks related to meme sentiment analysis and intent detection garner extensive
            attention from researchers. However, in the domain of meme offensiveness detection, existing studies largely overlook
            the critical role of metaphorical features. üåàTo fill this gap, we construct a <span class="rainbow-text">meme
              offensiveness detection dataset</span>, MetaOff-Meme, with metaphorical annotations, providing valuable resources for
            advancing research in this field. Furthermore, we
            propose a metaphor benchmark to evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art (SOTA) vision-language
            models (VLMs) in meme offensiveness detection. The results indicate that these models still face challenges in analyzing
            and detecting meme offensiveness, while metaphorical features contribute to improving the performance of meme
            offensiveness detection.

              <strong>Meme has becomea popular</strong> medium of expression among internet users, utilizing its multimodal nature to vividly and
              effectively convey emotions and intentions. However, some memes carry offensive undertones. The abuse of these offensive
              memes not only causes harm to individuals, but also poses profound negative impacts on social stability, public health,
              and the healthy development of the online environment. Meanwhile, with the emergence of large models, there is
              growing attention on whether the content generated by these models aligns with human ethics and values. Since large
              models may inadvertently generate offensive content, detecting and preventing the potential misuse of offensive memes is
              of critical importance. However, to evade regulation by online platforms, offensive content in memes is often expressed
              and disseminated in more implicit ways. These implicit expressions frequently rely on extensive use of metaphors to convey offensiveness. <br>

              <strong>Current models rely solely</strong> on multimodal sentiment analysis methods to identify offensive sentiments in memes, while
              neglecting the complex metaphorical features inherent within memes, which significantly limits their performance.
              Therefore, accurately understanding the metaphorical features underlying memes is key to effective offensiveness
              detection. To improve the performance of offensiveness detection for memes enriched with metaphorical content, we construct
              MetaOff-Meme consisting of 3,033 image-text pairs with manual annotations. <br>

              (1) <strong>Metaphor Annotation.</strong> MetaOff-Meme defines the syntactic
              structure of metaphors as: 'A' is as 'relationship' as 'B' and use this structure to expand the metaphors and
              metaphorical relationships within memes. In this syntactic structure, A and B represent the source domain and target
              domain of the metaphor, respectively, while the relationship denotes the shared comparative attribute between them.<br>

              (2) <strong>Offensiveness Annotation.</strong>
              Offensive memes are often presented in the form of humor or self-deprecation, appearing harmless on the surface but
              potentially embedding biases, discrimination, or malicious intent. The annotation process for meme offensiveness is
              shown in Figure 2(b). We first determine whether a meme is offensive. Subsequently, we perform fine-grained annotations
              on offensive memes in terms of offensive topic, level, and scope. <br><br>

              <strong>During the collection</strong> of offensive memes, we retained non-offensive memes to ensure sample diversity. According to
              Figure 3(a), offensive memes account for 61% of the total dataset, while non-offensive memes make up the remaining 39%.
              Further metaphorical analysis reveals that 82% of the samples contain metaphors. Offensive memes with metaphors make up
              53%, those without metaphors account for 29%, and non-metaphorical memes comprise only 18%. This distribution indicates
              that the use of metaphors is prevalent in offensive memes.<br>

              <strong>For offensive topics</strong>, as shown in Figure 3(b), gender-related topics account for the highest proportion, which may
              reflect the relatively high prevalence of such memes on social media platforms. For offensive level, as shown in Figure
              3(c), the distribution of memes across different levels of offensiveness is relatively balanced, with non-offensive
              memes accounting for the largest proportion at 39%. Among the remaining categories, slight, moderate, and severe levels
              exhibit a balanced distribution, suggesting that social media users tend to employ memes with varying degrees of
              offensiveness to convey harmful content. <br>

              <strong>According to Figure 3(d)</strong>, 73% of offensive memes are directed at specific groups, while the remaining 27% target
              individuals. This trend may be related to the formation of group dynamics and collective identities on social media
              platforms, as group-targeted memes are more likely to provoke broader discourse and interactions. <br><br>

              We propose four tasks based on MetaOff-Meme to evaluate the performance of meme offensiveness detection. The detailed
              descriptions of the tasks are as follows:<br>

              (1) <strong>Offensiveness Detection</strong> : a binary classification task to determine whether a meme is offensive. <br>
              (2) <strong>Offensive Topic Classification</strong>: a task aims to classify offensive memes into fine-grained categories, supporting a
              deeper understanding of their diversity.<br>
              (3) <strong>Offensive Level Evaluation</strong>: a task to evaluate the offensiveness level of memes, which helps measure their severity and
              more precisely assess their potential impact.<br>
              (4) <strong>Offensive Scope Analysis</strong>: a task to analyze the target scope of offensive memes, uncovering the groups or individuals
              targeted in their dissemination.<br>

              We select 5 SOTA open-source VLMs as experimental models to explore the current applications of multimodal large models
              in meme offensiveness detection. The models include Qwen-VL-Chat-7B, LLaVA-v1.5-7B, MiniGPT-v2-7B,
              InternVL2-8B, and MiniCPM-V2.6-7B.<br>

              We evaluate all data under a zero-shot setting. This setting enables the assessment of the generalization ability and
              cross-task performance of metaphors in meme offensiveness detection. To evaluate the performance of VLMs, we design
              three comparative experiments. The overall experimental process is shown in Figure 4. The evaluation benchmarks include
              the following:<br>
              
              (1) <strong>Baseline</strong> : We evaluate the VLMs using only the original meme features to assess the fundamental performance of VLMs in
              meme offensiveness detection.<br>
              (2) <strong>Metaphor Thought Chain (MCT)</strong> : In this setup, VLMs are required to first analyze metaphorical information within the
              meme before performing offensiveness detection. This experiment explores whether VLMs can correctly understand
              metaphorical expressions, and how this understanding influences offensiveness detection.<br>
              (3) <strong>Metaphor Information Augmentation (MIA)</strong> : Based on the original meme features, we further incorporate manually
              annotated metaphorical content to assist VLMs in offensiveness detection.<br>
              Through the above experiments, we not only evaluate the actual performance of current VLMs in meme offensiveness
              detection, but also analyze their ability to understand metaphors in memes, laying a foundation for deeper meme
              understanding by VLMs.<br><br>

              <strong>In the offensiveness detection task</strong>, MiniGPT-v2 achieves the best performance after introducing
              manually annotated metaphorical content. LLaVA-v1.5 shows a significant improvement under the MCT setting, primarily due
              to its tendency to adopt non-offensive descriptions when analyzing metaphors, which helps correct a large number of
              memes that were previously misclassified as offensive. Qwen-VL-Chat performs worse than the baseline in both MCT and MIA
              settings. We observe that Qwen-VL-Chat tends to classify most memes as offensive, and this bias is further amplified
              after metaphorical content is introduced. Overall, MIA improves their performance in offensiveness detection task.<br>

              <strong>In the other three tasks</strong>, all models perform better under the MIA setting compared to the baseline.
              However, their performance under the MCT setting is relatively unstable. Our experiments reveal that VLMs primarily
              focus on the visual content of memes when analyzing metaphors, failing to effectively incorporate textual information
              for metaphorical reasoning. This introduces noise into the detection process and consequently affects the recognition
              performance.<br>

              <strong>From the average scores of the overall results</strong>, we observe that manually annotated metaphorical content
              can effectively enhance model performance in meme offensiveness detection. However, due to the poor performance of
              Qwen-VL-Chat in the offensiveness detection task, the overall average improvement is relatively limited. Under the MCT
              setting, we find that most models fail to accurately understand the metaphorical expressions embedded in memes,
              resulting in incorrect metaphorical content that misleads the final prediction and degrades performance compared to the
              baseline. This indicates that current models lack the capability to comprehend metaphorical expressions.<br><br>

            We propose a novel metaphor benchmark and a metaphor-enriched offensive meme dataset, MetaOff-Meme. MetaOff-Meme
            provides detailed metaphorical annotations and offensive labels for memes. It presents significant challenges to
            existing VLMs, as they must accurately comprehend the underlying metaphorical information to correctly identify
            offensive content in memes. Experimental results from SOTA VLMs reveal that these models still face limitations in meme
            offensiveness detection. Our work introduces rich metaphorical information into offensive memes, paving a new path for
            advancing meme offensiveness detection. We hope that our dataset, novel benchmarks, and research insights will serve as
            valuable resources for researchers in related fields.<br><br>
